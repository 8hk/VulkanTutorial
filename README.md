# VulkanTutorial

Following the [Vulkan (c++) Game Engine Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) from [Brendan Galea](https://www.youtube.com/@BrendanGalea)

New branch is going to be created for each tutorial.
I've used Vulkan and CMake for the whole project.
I did not follow Brendan completely, I've updated the code if it is needed. 

# Branches

Each branch is going to be added in following sections

## 1st Tutorial
In this tutorial, new window has been created by using GLFW. 
You can access the branch from [here](https://github.com/8hk/VulkanTutorial/tree/tutorial_1)
